 * @todo		  Watchers are here so that clients can see the project and track the progress without getting full member benefits.  This idea was fully thought out yet, and for it to be fully extensible you would also need to be able to manage project watcher permissions, and so your user role might need to change.  A whole big mess could be made here if you're not careful.
